# Enhancing Industrial Robotic Efficiency Through Reinforcement Learning: Integrating AI-Enabled Pre-Adjustment Systems For Optimal Speed And Energy Consumption

In industrial automation, robotic arms are crucial in executing drilling, welding, and assembling
tasks. Despite their advanced capabilities, these robots operate based on pre-designed displacements,
which are not optimized for critical operational parameters like speed, acceleration, and position.
The complexity of the arm joint mechanisms, combined with a myriad of constraints and safety
mandates, requires engineers to manually plan the robotic armsâ€™ movements, from picking up to
placing objects. This manual planning is time-consuming and needs to achieve optimal efficiency
and energy utilization.
To address these inefficiencies, this thesis introduces the application of Reinforcement Learning
(RL) to automate and optimize the displacement of robotic arms, ensuring optimal speed, accel-
eration, and positional accuracy within the boundaries of safety and operational constraints. By
enhancing the AI-enabled pre-adjustment systems of robotic arm joints with RL, the thesis proposes
a method for robotic arms to dynamically adapt to various tasks autonomously. This innovative ap-
proach is poised to significantly improve operational efficiency and energy conservation in industrial
settings, promising a new era of productivity and sustainability in manufacturing processes
